## üéØ My Honest Assessment

### **The Good News** ‚úÖ
1. **Medusa v2 is built for this** - The framework makes custom modules easy
2. **Next.js is perfect** - Server components + image optimization = fast
3. **Most features are straightforward** - 70% are moderate complexity
4. **High ROI** - Jewelry customers expect these features

### **The Challenges** ‚ö†Ô∏è
1. **Time investment** - 3.5-4.5 months for everything
2. **AR is complex** - Requires 3D models + specialized knowledge
3. **Content creation** - Technical implementation is just the start
4. **Testing across devices** - Jewelry needs to look perfect everywhere

### **The Reality Check** üí°
- **Don't build everything at once** - Start with MVP (4 weeks)
- **Some features can wait** - AR, virtual consultation can be phase 2
- **Buy vs. Build** - Use Calendly for consultations instead of building
- **Content takes time** - Blog articles, photography, videos are ongoing
- **Focus on revenue drivers** - Images, reviews, customization first
